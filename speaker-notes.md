**Potential Questions & Responses:**

**Q: "How does this compare to GitHub Copilot?"**
A: "Great question. Copilot is excellent at code completion, but OpenHands is designed for full autonomous development workflows. Think of Copilot as a very smart autocomplete, while OpenHands agents can plan, execute, and iterate on complete tasks."

**Q: "What about safety and security concerns?"**
A: "This is crucial. The sandboxed execution environment is a key innovation here. Unlike systems that might execute code directly on your machine, OpenHands isolates all execution in containers with strict resource and network limitations."

**Q: "How reproducible are the results?"**
A: "The evaluation framework is designed for reproducibility. All benchmarks run in standardized environments, and the code is open source. However, LLM non-determinism can still be a factor."

**Q: "What are the computational requirements?"**
A: "This varies significantly by agent and task complexity. Simple tasks might run on modest hardware, but complex reasoning tasks require substantial compute. The paper doesn't provide detailed resource analysis, which would be valuable future work."

**Q: "How could this be used in education?"**
A: "Fascinating application area. Imagine AI teaching assistants that can actually run and debug student code, provide personalized feedback, and even generate custom exercises. But we'd need to be thoughtful about maintaining learning objectives."

**Wrap-up:** Thank the audience, encourage further exploration, and offer to continue discussions offline.
